# Coursera Neural Networks for Machine Learning

This repository contains starter code for programming assignments in Python.

The original starter code is in Matlab/Octave.

This is my translation to Python 3 of the starter code.

This repository doesn't contain solutions to the assignments, because that would mean violation of the Coursera Honor Code.

I was able to pass the assignments, and achieve the grade of 100% on them by using these Python versions, which means the code has been translated correctly.
